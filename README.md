The gym enviroment can be a complex enviroment for people who are new to this type of exercising routine. What many gym enthusists consider simple exercises can appear confussing to anyone not familiar with the concepts.
While many gyms have people on hand who can provide help if asked, this can sometimes depend on availability such as if personal training sessions are in play. There are also usually wall charts which detail various exercises,
however many people are put off viewing such material due to making it very evident of thier new start status. All of these considerations can be overwhelming for many and can put people off from making that all important first
step into the local gym. 

Gym-Budy is a simple and personal solution that provides names, descriptions and images of the most common exercises found in gyms accross the world utilising the most common equipment. To facilitate quick refrencing, 
exercises are grouped per bodypart. This also doubles as an educational approach that allows the user to quickly become familiar with which exercises affect which bodypart.

## UX
 
Due to the multi-page requirements (12 in total) required to provide suitable and clear seperation of the individual bodypart areas commonly trained in the gym enviroment, a clear and decisive navigation bar is required. The Nav-Bar
will need to provide quick, minimal click and logical access to all pages.

Keeping the gym enviroment in mind the Gym-Buddy aplication has the following user consideration when deployed on different devices:

- Mobile - A mobile first approach was considered as it is envisioned that the app can be deployed within the gym enviroment for real time refrencing of the exercises required and to suit the equipment available. This also provides a 
discreat way of refrencing for those self consious about appearing new to the gym enviroment. This is considered the majority user case scenario as the majority will have a mobile phone and will also be utilising this technology
to provide music or health data tracking. 

- Tablet - While less common, a tablet can also be used in the gym enviroment in the same way as a mobile phone. This would provide a larger screen experience for those that chooseprefer this approach. It is also considered that home 
use will be the majority use case for tablets where Gym-Buddy could be used for familiarisation or referece.

- Computer/Laptop - Not imposible but certainly unusual, laptops can be taken into the gym. It is, however, in this use case considered that the computer deployment of this app would be for referencing/educational purposes at home. 
Some people may prefer to log the relavant exercises in a workout diary and use this app from a home computer for reference.
